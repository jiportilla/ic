  "description": "This class prepares students to compete against other high school, community college and university teams from around the country and world in the 2020 MATE Underwater Robotics Competition. Our team will design, build, and test an underwater drone, and will also develop a marketing approach to sell our product.  You will learn and apply engineering skills like computer-aided design, fabrication, electronics, programming and principles of aquatic physics. We will at a minimum participate in one regional competition in the US; if we qualify, we will travel to Monterrey, California in June 2020 to compete in the 2020 MATE International Competition.",
